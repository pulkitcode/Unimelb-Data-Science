# Unimelb-Data-Science
A brief overview about the subjects I did while at Unimelb pursuing an undergraduate degree majoring in Data Science

<h1>COMP10001 - Foundations of Computing</h1>

A very fun subject but requires good amount of workload if you haven't had any programming experience.

<h1>COMP10002 - Foundations of Algorithms</h1>

A bit tougher than COMP10001, the language taught is C, the projects were a bit hard but exam was comparatively easier. Good content though.

<h1>COMP20003 - Algos and Data Structures</h1>

Heavy Emphasis on Malloc so would definitely not recomment doing ENG COMP before this but yeah apparently even if you do get valgrind errors, they don't cut as many marks in projects as you think. But yeah you have to pass automatic testing otherwise you messed up big time. Quite a few subjects starting from second year COMP cut marks if you don't pass automatic testing.
