# Unimelb-Computing

A brief overview about the subjects I did while at Unimelb pursuing an undergraduate degree majoring in Computing and Software Systems.

Here are the subjects that I did and currently doing over the past 2 years. I was going on exchange to NUS but that got cancelled (twice), I have planned my entire third year on exchange to UIUC, Chicago. If you want advice on any of the subjects below or exchange, text me on linkedin or messenger.

<h3>COMP10001 - Foundations of Computing</h3>

A very fun subject but requires good amount of workload if you haven't had any programming experience.

<h3>ECON10004 - Introductory Microeconomics</h3>

One of the best subjects that I did at university, I never did economics before coming to university and this subject has good amount of workload but once you get a hold of it, you can easily do well in this subject. Teaches you about nash equilibrium and very small insights of game theory. Probably contact friends who have done this subject before and they can help you a lot.

<h3>COMP10002 - Foundations of Algorithms</h3>

A bit tougher than COMP10001, the language taught is C, the projects were a bit hard but exam was comparatively easier. Good content though.


<h3>COMP20003 - Algos and Data Structures</h3>

Heavy Emphasis on Malloc so would definitely not recomment doing ENG COMP before this but yeah apparently even if you do get valgrind errors, they don't cut as many marks in projects as you think. But yeah you have to pass automatic testing otherwise you messed up big time. Quite a few subjects starting from second year COMP cut marks if you don't pass automatic testing.
<h3>INFO20003 - Database Systems</h3>

Good subject to get SQL Knowledge and might be helpful later if you want to get a career in the data field. The subject itself is pretty dry in my opinion. Easier to score in comparison to other level 2 subjects.

<h3>CCDP10003 - Video Games</h3>

I did this subject just to get a bit of a break from uni and explore other stuff. It required a week's work in total and gave an easy H1. Best part, the lecturer is really cool and if you get to go to lectures they're really fun. I didn't attend many lectures but they're pretty good in my opinion. Many people think this is a waste of money (yeah that's true) but it gives you time to do your core subjects well and reduces the stress of uni.

<h3>MAST20004 - Probability</h3>

This is said to be one of the hard subjects which is not that true in my opinion, if you follow up with the subject content, you can do pretty well on this subject. Keep in mind to do all the past exams because half the exam in my semester came from the past exams. Random Variables can be pretty daunting at first but becomes easy once you get a hold of them. The last topics like Markov Chains are literally free marks so practice them well.

<h3>SCIE30002 - Science and Tech Internship</h3>

I wanted to get the taste of real world data science work so I cold emailed some professors whether they have any research projects I can contribute to. The professors at Unimelb are very helpful and even if they had no projects, they connected me to other professors which eventually gave me a research intern position at uni. Doing unpaid work is worth the effort if that work teaches you a lot. I told my supervisor to give me a lot of work just so that I can learn. (Cold emailing professors and getting projects is much easier than finding a placement outside of uni).
